vim syntax and filetype support for bun.

## install

we all know how to install vim plugins don't we. install it however you like. vim-plug example:

```
Plug 'hedyhli/vim-bun'
```

remember to put between the plug calls and run `PlugInstall`... you know the drill

if you have no idea what I'm talking about you should go find a vim plugin tutorial

If you don't want to use the github repo you can use the
[git.rawtext.club](https://git.rawtext.club/hedy/vim-bun) remote.
